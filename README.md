# Reddit Affiliate Link Remover

Description
-
Reddit Affiliate Link Remover is a web browser extension userscript that finds affiliate links on Reddit web pages and replaces them with their actual destination links.

Purpose
-
This extension was developed to protect user privacy against tracking data and to help maintain an uninterrupted web browsing experience. Affiliate links are useful for the web pages that host them, however they are not very beneficial to web users. These types of links track user data and can also result in web pages not loading correctly given the presence of ad blockers or disabled hosts. Affiliate links interfere with the web browsing experience and this extension aims to limit their negative effects on users.

How It Works
-

Reddit replaces some hyperlinks on their website with affiliate links that eventually redirect to the actual destination URL. This extension can work one of two ways:

1. The default behavior of the extension is to replace an affiliate URL with the actual destination URL whenever you hover over an affiliate link.
2. You can also choose to automatically replace every affiliate URL with the destination URL after a page loads by uncommenting that section in the code. This may cause the page to load more slowly which is why it's not the default behavior.

Install & Update
-
This userscript is meant to be used with the extensions Greasemonkey for Mozilla Firefox and Tampermonkey for Google Chrome. It may or may not be compatible with other extensions or web browsers.

1. Install the Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey extension for your web browser.
2. Go to the [raw userscript source](https://github.com/norrism/reddit-affiliate-link-remover/raw/master/reddit-affiliate-link-remover.user.js) to install or update to the latest version of this userscript.
